# File-Systems
The goals of this project are three-fold:
  To investigate the use of field delimiters and record sizes for field and record organization.
  To build and maintain an in-memory primary key index to improve search efficiency.
  To use an in-memory availability list to support the reallocation of space for records that are deleted.
